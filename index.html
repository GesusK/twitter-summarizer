    <h1>Tweet Summarizer</h1>
    <p>This is an <strong>experiment</strong> which generates an <em>abstractive</em> summary of a large stream of tweets pertaining to a common topic.</p>
    <p>The search string is used to retrieve 100 <em>popular</em> and <em>new</em> tweets, and the tweets are then fed to a graph-based summarizer which identifies <em>common</em> and possibly <em>discontinuous</em> sub-strings among the documents, and creates a pool of candidate strings. The final summary is chosen by ranking the candidate strings.</p>
